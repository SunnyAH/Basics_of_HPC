Assignments based on Jan 6 Lecture 

1. Similar to group2d.c, write an MPI program to form row-wise sub-communicators for a 2D virtual topology, using MPI_Comm_split function.

2. Use MPI_Cart_create to form 2D Cartesian communicator, followed by the two functions:
   MPI_Cart_coords (https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.1/www3/MPI_Cart_coords.html)
   MPI_Cart_rank   (https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.1/www3/MPI_Cart_rank.html)
